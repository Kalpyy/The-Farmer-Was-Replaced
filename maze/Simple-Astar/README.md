A simple unoptimized version of my recursive A* algorithm, the original algorithm was devised by danielrab.

Some benchmarks:
First 50 mazes avg: 15.61
50 - 100 mazes avg: 8.14
100 - 150 mazes avg: 6.82
150 - 200 mazes avg: 6.21
200 - 250 mazes avg: 5.84
250 - 300 mazes avg: 5.68

Overall Avg: 48.32
Avged over 500 iterations

Done with max speed and power
To get op counts just multiply the time by 16800
