A simple unoptimized version of my recursive A* algorithm, the original algorithm was devised by danielrab.

Some benchmarks: 

| iterations       |  time      |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| 0-50             | 15.61s     |
| 50-100           | 8.14s      |
| 100-150          | 6.82s      |
| 150-200          | 6.21s      |
| 200-250          | 5.84s      |
| 250-300          | 5.68s      |

Overall Avg: 48.32

Avged over 500 iterations

Done with max speed and power

To get op counts just multiply the time by 16800
